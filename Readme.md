# AI_Algorithms

This repository gathers the different AI algorithms that I've implemented.

## Currently available :
***1) Classifiers :*** Lineare Classier, Binary Classier, Multiclass Classifier, Regression \
***2) Computer Vision :*** MNIST Classification (CNN), Dog and Cat classifiers (using con2D et MaxPooling), Dog and Cat segmentation (using Conv2D and Conv2DTranspose)

***Comming*** : Algorithms for Computer Vision

For the majority of them, I'm using the book : **Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Editon by Fran√ßois Chollet**.
