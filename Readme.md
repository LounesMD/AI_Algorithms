# MyClassifiers

This repository gathers the different AI algorithms that I've implemented.

***Currently available*** : Lineare Classier, Binary Classier, Multiclass Classifier, Regression \
***Comming*** : Algorithms for Computer Vision

For the majority of them, I'm using the book : **Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Editon by François Chollet**.
